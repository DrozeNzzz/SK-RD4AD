# SK-RD4AD: Skip-Connected Reverse Distillation for One-Class Anomaly Detection

Welcome to the repository for SK-RD4AD! This repository focuses on Skip-Connected Reverse Distillation for One-Class Anomaly Detection, a technique developed for the CVPR 2025 Workshop. If you are interested in anomaly detection, computer vision, industrial AI, one-class classification, skip connections, or vision AI, this repository is the place to be.

## Overview

SK-RD4AD is a novel approach to anomaly detection that leverages skip connections and reverse distillation to achieve superior performance in identifying anomalies in industrial settings. The technique has been specifically designed to address the challenges faced in one-class anomaly detection, providing a robust solution that can be applied to a variety of computer vision tasks.

## Key Features

- **Skip Connections:** By incorporating skip connections within the architecture, SK-RD4AD enables the model to capture both low-level and high-level features, enhancing the ability to detect anomalies effectively.

- **Reverse Distillation:** The use of reverse distillation ensures that the model can distill knowledge learned from a teacher model, improving the overall performance of anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.
